NOTE: this is an example of what can be done with Slots. It is *not* an example of what *should* be done with Slots.

I am a slot that compiles accessor methods in the Class that it is installes in.  When the slot is removed, the accessors are removed, too.

This example shows how Slots can change the class that they are part of.

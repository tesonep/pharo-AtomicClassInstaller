I am BenchmarkResult. 

I know how much iterations where executed in a specific elapsed time duration.

I am the result of running the same piece of code multiple times.

I can compute my average #frequencey (#executionsPerSecond) and #period (#timePerExecution).

I have a human friendly print representation.

BenchmarkResult new
	iterations: 20000;
	elapsedTime: 10 seconds;
	yourself.
